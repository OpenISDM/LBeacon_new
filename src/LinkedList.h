* Project Name:

*
* File Description:
*
*      This header file contains the function declarations and
*      variables used in the LinkedList.c file.
*
* File Name:
*
*      LinkedList.h
*
* Abstract:
*
*      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
*      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon
*      is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and
*      location description of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS
*      (Building/environment Data and Information System) and stored locally
*      during deployment and maintenance times. Once initialized, each LBeacon
*      broadcasts its coordinates and location description to Bluetooth
*      enabled user devices within its coverage area.
