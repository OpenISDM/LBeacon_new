 *
 * File Description:
 *
 *      This file contains the implementation of a queue data structure. It has
 *      the feature of enqueueing a node to the front of the queue and
 *      dequeueing a node to the end of the queue. It can also peek at the
 *      node in the front of the queue and print a list of all the nodes in the
 *      queue. The purpose of this queue implementation is to allow scanned MAC
 *      addresses to wait
 *
 * File Name:
 *
 *      Queue.c
 *
 * Abstract:
 *
 *      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
 *      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon
 *      is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and
 *      location description of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS
 *      (Building/environment Data and Information System) and stored locally
 *      during deployment and maintenance times. Once initialized, each LBeacon
 *      broadcasts its coordinates and location description to Bluetooth
 *      enabled user devices within its coverage area.
