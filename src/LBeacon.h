Project Name:

    BeDIS

File Description:

    This header file contains declarations of variables, structs and
    functions and definitions of global variables used in the LBeacon.c file.

File Name:

    LBeacon.h

Version:

    2.0,  20190911

Abstract:

    BeDIS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
    descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a
    LBeacon is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D
    coordinates and location description of every LBeacon are retrieved
    from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) and
    stored locally during deployment and maintenance times. Once
    initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and location
    description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
    area.
