 * Abstract:
 *
 *      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
 *      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a LBeacon
 *      is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D coordinates and
 *      location description of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS
 *      (Building/environment Data and Information System) and stored locally
 *      during deployment and maintenance times. Once initialized, each LBeacon
 *      broadcasts its coordinates and location description to Bluetooth
 *      enabled user devices within its coverage area.
