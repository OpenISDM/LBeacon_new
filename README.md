# LBeacon

LBeacon (Location Beacon): BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver to users the 3D coordinates and textual descriptions of their locations. Basically, LBeacon is a low-cost, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. At deployment and maintenance times, the 3D coordinates and location description of every LBeacon are retrieved from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) and stored locally. Once initialized, each LBeacon broadcast its coordinates and location description to Bluetooth enabled mobile devices nearby within its coverage area.

Alpha version of LBeacon was demonstrated during Academia Sinica open house and will be experimented with and assessed by collaborators of the project.
