# Lbeacon

This application is called LBeacon(Location Beacon) which is used to deliver location information to users. Basically, Lbeacon is a low-cost, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. At deployment and maintenance times, the 3D coordinates of every Lbeacon are retrieved from BeDIC(Building and Environment Data/Information Cloud) and stored locally. Once initialized, each Lbeacon broadcast its coordinates to HereUAre, a simple messaging application on Bluetooth enabled mobile device nearby.
